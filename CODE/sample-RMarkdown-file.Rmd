The beginning of this text is automatically generated by RStudio when you create a new R Markdown file. You can edit this text to customize the title, author, and date of the document. The `output` field specifies the format of the output document. In this case, the output will be an HTML document. (You can change that to PDF or Word if you prefer, both in the YAML header and in the "Knit" dropdown menu.)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Including mathematical expressions

Markdown is a simple way to format text that includes equations. You can include mathematical expressions both inline $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$ and displayed:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2} \, dx = \sqrt{\pi}.
$$
Formatting mathematical text is done using $\LaTeX$ syntax. For example, the code `$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$` is rendered as $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

## Including `R` code in the text

It is also possible to include R code in the text by using a `r` followed by an R expression after a space, all between a pair of single backticks. 
So I can for example write that the `cars` dataset has `r nrow(cars)` rows and `r ncol(cars)` columns. 

# One important remark: .Rmd $\neq$ .R

This is in particular addressed to (from experience) Computer Science students: **code blocks** are not meant for you to paste your entire R code!
When marking assignments, we will be looking for a notebook feel, not just code that runs. This means that you should include text, explanations, and interpretations of your results as part of a coherent Markdown narrative, not stuff everything in code blocks (regardless of how much commenting of your code you do).

### Solution worth $\lim_{x \to 0} x$ marks

```{r}
# Generate the matrix
M = matrix(c(1,2,3,
             4,5,6,
             7,8,9), 
           nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
# Compute the determinant
det(M)
# We observe that the determinant is zero (within numerical tolerance), the matrix is not invertible
```

### Solution worth a positive number of marks
We generate the matrix
```{r}
M = matrix(c(1,2,3,
             4,5,6,
             7,8,9), 
           nrow=3, ncol=3, byrow=TRUE)
```
and compute its determinant, finding det(M)=`r det(M)`. We observe that the determinant is zero (within numerical tolerance), which means that the matrix is not invertible.
