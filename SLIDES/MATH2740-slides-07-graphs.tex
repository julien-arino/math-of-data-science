\begin{frame}{Graphs versus networks}
	Mostly a terminology difference:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item graphs in the mathematical world
	\item networks elsewhere
	\end{itemize}
	\vfill
	I will mostly say \emph{graphs} (this is a math course) but might oscillate
	\vfill
	Beware: language is not consistent, so make sure you read the definitions at the start of whatever source you are using
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Graphs vs digraphs vs multigraphs vs multidigraphs vs ...}
	Name-wise and notation-wise, this domain is a mess. We see definitions later, but as far as possible, in these notes:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The vertex set $V$ is essentially the only constant in what follows.
		\item An undirected graph is denoted $G=(V,E)$, where $E$ are the edges.
		\item An undirected multigraph is denoted $G_M=(V,E)$. We will not be using these much.
		\item A directed graph (or digraph) is denoted $G=(V,A)$, where $A$ are the arcs.
		\item A directed multigraph (or multidigraph) is denoted $G_M=(V,A)$.
		\item Any of the above is called a graph and is denoted $G=(V,X)$, when we seek generality.
	\end{itemize}
And just to confuse the whole thing more: we often say \emph{graph} for \emph{unoriented graph}.

\section{Undirected graphs}


\subsection{Undirected graph}


\begin{frame}{Graph}
	Intuitively: a graph is a set of points, and a set of relations between the points
	\vfill
	The points are called the \emph{vertices} of the graph and the relations are the \emph{edges} of the graph
	\vfill
	We can also think of the relations as being one directional, in which case the relations are the \emph{arcs} of the digraph (a contraction of ``directed graph``)
\end{frame}

	\item $E$ is a set of 2-element subsets of $V$: $E=\{\{v_i,v_j\},\{v_i,v_k\},\dots,\{v_n,v_p\}\}$, also noted $E=\{v_iv_j,v_iv_k,\dots,v_nv_p\}$.
	\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Vertex]
	The elements of $V$ are the \defword{vertices} (or nodes, or points) of the graph $G$.
	$V$ is the vertex set of the graph $G$, also noted $V(G)$.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Edge]
	The elements of $E$ are the \defword{edges} (or lines) of the graph $G$.
	$E$ is the edge set of the graph $G$, also noted $E(G)$.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Order and Size}
	\begin{definition}[Order of a graph]
	The number of vertices in $G$ is the \defword{order} of $G$. Using the notation $|V(G)|$ for the \emph{cardinality} of $V(G)$,
	$$|V(G)|=\textrm{order of G}.$$
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Size of a graph]
	The number of edges in $G$ is the \defword{size} of $G$,
	$$|E(G)|=\textrm{size of G}.$$
	\end{definition}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item A graph having order $p$ and size $q$ is called a $(p,q)-$graph.
	\item A graph is finite if $|V(G)|<\infty$.

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Adjacent - Incident}
	\begin{definition}[Incident]

	\item The two vertices incident with an edge are its ends.
	%\item An edge $e=uv$ is incident with both vertices $u$ and $v$
	\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Adjacent]
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent in a graph $G$ if $uv\in E(G)$. 
	\item If $uv$ and $uw$ are distinct edges (i.e. $v\not=w$) of a graph $G$, then $uv$ and $uw$ are adjacent edges.
	\end{itemize}
	\end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\begin{definition}[Multiple edge]
	{\bf Multiple edges} are two or more edges connecting the same two vertices within a multigraph.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Loop]

	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Multigraph]

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Graph and binary relations}
	A (simple) graph $G$ can be defined in term of a vertex set $V$ and an irreflexive and symmetric binary relation over $V$.
	
	$R$ is symmetric if $(u,v)\in R$ $\Rightarrow$ $(v,u)\in R$  (or, in other words, $uRv\implies vRu$).
	
	Hence, $\{(u,v),(v,u)\}\in E(G)$ ($\{(u,v),(v,u)\}$ is an edge).

	The set of edges $E(G)$ is the set of symmetric pairs in $R$.
\end{frame}


\subsection{Degree of a vertex}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}\frametitle{Bipartite graph}
	\begin{definition}[Bipartite graph]
		A graph $G=(V,E)$ is called {\bf bipartite} if it is possible to partition the vertex set of $G$ into two subsets, say $V_1$ and $V_2$ so that every edge of $G$ joins a vertex of $V_1$ with a vertex of $V_2$ and no vertex joins another vertex of its own set.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Bipartite graph]
		A graph is \textbf{bipartite} if its vertices can be partitioned into two sets $X_1$ and $X_2$, s.t. no two vertices in the same set are adjacent.
		This graph may be written $G=(X_1,X_2,U)$
	\end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}\frametitle{Complete Bipartite graph}
	\begin{definition}[Complete bipartite graph]
		A bipartite graph in which every two vertices from the 2 different partitions are adjacent is called a complete bipartite graph.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[Complete bipartite graph]
		If $\forall x_1\in X_1, \forall x_2\in X$, we have $m_G(x_1,x_2)\geq 1$, then $G=(X_1,X_2,U)$ is a \textbf{complete bipartite} graph
		\vskip0.5cm
		A simple, complete bipartite graph with $|X_1|=p$ and $|X_2|=q$ is often denoted $K_{p,q}$

	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[{Path $P_n$}]
		The path, $P_n$, is a connected graph that consists of $n\geq 2$ vertices and $n-1$ edges. Two vertices of $P_n$ have degree 1 and the rest are of degree 2.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{definition}[{Star $S_n$}]
		The star of order $n$ is the complete bipartite graph $K_{1,n-1}$ (1 vertex of degree $n-1$, and $n-1$ vertices of degree 1).

\end{frame}





\subsection{Isomorphic graphs}

\begin{frame} \frametitle{Isomorphic graphs} 
\begin{definition}[Isomorphic graphs]
Let $G_1=(V(G_1),E(G_1))$ and $G_2=(V(G_2),E(G_2))$ be two graphs.
$G_1$ and $G_2$ are \textbf{isomorphic} if there exists an isomorphism $\phi$ from $G_1$ to $G_2$, that is defined as an injective mapping $\phi:\; V(G_1) \rightarrow V(G_2)$ such that two vertices $u_1$ and $v_1$ are adjacent in $G_1$ if and only if the vertices $\phi(u_1)$ and $\phi(v_1)$ are adjacent in $G_2$.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Another formulation of isomorphic graphs]
Let $G_1=(V(G_1),E(G_1))$ and $G_2=(V(G_2),E(G_2))$ be two graphs;
$G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic if there exists an isomorphism $\phi$ from $G_1$ to $G_2$, defined as 
an injective mapping $\phi : \; V(G_1) \rightarrow V(G_2)$ such that $\{u_1,v_1\} \in E(G_1)$ if and only if $\{\phi(u_1),\phi(v_1)\}\in E(G_2)$ for all $u_1, v_1 \in V(G_1)$.
\end{definition}
\end{frame}
 
 
 
\begin{frame}
If $\phi$ is an isomorphism from $G_1$ to $G_2$, then the inverse mapping $\phi ^{-1}$ from $V(G_2)$ to $V(G_1)$ also satisfies the definition of an isomorphism.

As a consequence, if $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic graphs, then
\begin{itemize}
\item $G_1$ is isomorphic to $G_2$
\item $G_2$ is isomorphic to $G_1$
\end{itemize}
\begin{theorem}
The relation ``is isomorphic to'' is an equivalence relation on the set of all graphs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
If $G_1$ and $G_2$ are isomorphic graphs, then the degrees of vertices of $G_1$ are exactly the degrees of vertices of $G_2$.
\end{theorem}

\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[Another definition of subgraph]

\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[{Disjoint graphs}]
If $G_1\cap G_2=(\emptyset,\emptyset)= \emptyset$ (empty graph) then $G_1$ and $G_2$ are disjoint.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}[{Complement of $G_1$}]
The complement $\bar G_1$ of $G_1$ is the graph on $V_1$, with the edge set $E(\bar G_1)=[V_1]^2\backslash E_1$ ($e\in E(\bar G_1)$ iff $e\not \in E_1$).

\begin{theorem}[Characterisation of trees]\label{th:characterisation_tree}
$H=(X,U)$ a graph of order $|X|=n>2$. The following are equivalent and all characterise a tree :
\begin{enumerate}
\item $H$ connected and has no cycles
\item $H$ has $n-1$ arcs and no cycles
\item $H$ connected and has exactly $n-1$ arcs
\item $H$ has no cycles, and if an arc is added to $H$, exactly one cycle is created
\item $H$ connected, and if any arc is removed, the remaining graph is not
connected
\item Every pair of vertices of $H$ is connected by one and only one chain
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Proof of Theorem~\ref{th:characterisation_tree}}
We make abundant use of Theorem~\ref{th:cyclomatic_nb}
\vfill
[$\mathbf{1\implies 2}$] 
Let $p$ be the number of connected components, $m$ the number of arcs and $\nu(H)$ the cyclomatic number. Since $H$ connected, $p=1$. Since $H$ has no cycles, $\nu(H)=m-n+p=0$

$\implies$ $m=n-p=n-1$
\vfill

[$\mathbf{2\implies 3}$] 
Assume $H$ has no cycles ($\nu(H)=0$) and has $n-1$ arcs ($m=n-1$). Then, since
\[
\nu(H)=m-n+p
\]
$p=\nu(H)-m+n=0-(n-1)-n=1$, i.e., $H$ is connected
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof of Theorem~\ref{th:characterisation_tree} (cont.)}
[$\mathbf{3\implies 4}$]
Assume $H$ connected ($p=1$) and contains exactly $n-1$ arcs ($m=n-1$). Then
\[
\nu(H)=m-n+p=(n-1)-n+1=0
\]
and $H$ has no cycles
\vskip0.5cm
Now add an arc, i.e., suppose $m=n$. Then $\nu(H)=m-n+p=n-n+1=1$ and there is one cycle in the new graph
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Proof of Theorem~\ref{th:characterisation_tree} (cont.)}
[$\mathbf{4\implies 5}$]
Assume $H$ has no cycles ($\nu(H)=0$) and that addition of an arc to $H$ creates exactly one cycle
\vskip0.5cm
Suppose $H$ not connected. Then there are two vertices, say $a$ and $b$, that are not connected and adding the arc $(a,b)$ does not create a cycle, a contradiction with ``addition of an arc to $H$ creates exactly one cycle'' 

$\implies$ $p=1$. Since $\nu(H)=0$, this implies that $m=n-1$
\vskip0.5cm
Now suppose we remove an arc. We obtain graph $H'$ with
\[
m'=n'-2\quad\text{and}\quad \nu(H')=0
\]
So
\[
p'=\nu(H')-m'+n'=2
\]
$\implies$ $H'$ not connected
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Proof of Theorem~\ref{th:characterisation_tree} (cont.)}
[$\mathbf{5\implies 6}$]
Assume $H$ connected and if any arc is removed, the remaining graph is not connected
\vskip0.5cm
Any vertices $a,b\in X$ are connected by a chain (since $H$ connected). That chain is unique: suppose there is a second chain connecting $a$ to $b$; then removing an arc from that chain does not disconnect the graph, since there is still the original chain connecting $a$ and $b$
\vfill
[$\mathbf{6\implies 1}$]
Assume every pair of vertices of $H$ is connected by one and only one chain

Now assume $H$ has a cycle. Then at least one pair of vertices would be connected by two distinct chains, a contradiction
$\qed$

A vertex is \textbf{pendant} if it is adjacent to exactly one other vertex
\end{definition}
\vfill
\begin{theorem}
A tree of order $n\geq 2$ has at least two pendant vertices
\end{theorem}
\vfill
\textbf{Proof:} 
Suppose $H$ tree of order $n\geq 2$ with 0 or 1 pendant vertices
\vskip0.5cm
Consider a traveller traversing the graph edges starting from a pendant vertex (if there is one) or anywhere if there is no pendant vertex
\vskip0.5cm
If he does not allow himself to use same edge twice, he cannot go to the same vertex twice ($H$ has no cycle)
\vskip0.5cm
If he arrives at vertex $x$, he can depart $x$ using a new edge ($x$ is not a pendant vertex as there are 0 or 1 pendant vertex and if there is 1, that's where he started)
\vskip0.5cm
So the trip continues without end, which is impossible as $H$ finite $\qed$

\end{theorem}
\vfill
Recall that a partial graph is a graph generated by a subset of the arcs (Definition~\ref{def:partial_graph} slide~\pageref{def:partial_graph})
\vfill
\textbf{Proof:}
Suppose $G$ not connected. Then no partial graph of $G$ is connected $\implies$ there is no partial graph of $G$ that is a tree [we want to show $P\iff Q$, we start with $\wedge Q\implies \wedge P$ (which $\iff$ $P\implies Q$)]
\vskip1cm
Suppose $G$ connected. Look for an arc whose removal does not disconnect $G$
\begin{itemize}
\item if there is none, $G$ is a tree by Theorem~\ref{th:characterisation_tree}(5)
\item if there is, remove it and look for another one, etc. When no more arcs can be removed, the remaining graph is a tree with vertex set $X$ $\qed$
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Spanning tree}
The procedure in the proof of Theorem~\ref{th:partial_graph_tree_G_connected} gives a \textbf{spanning tree}
\vfill
Can also build a spanning tree as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider any arc $u_0$
\item Find arc $u_1$ that does not form a cycle with $u_0$
\item Find arc $u_2$ that does not form a cycle with $\{u_0,u_1\}$
\item Continue
\item When you cannot continue anymore, you have a spanning tree

\begin{theorem}
$G$ connected graph with $\geq 1$ arc. TFAE
\begin{enumerate}
\item $G$ strongly connected
\item Every arc lies on a circuit
\item $G$ contains no cocircuits
\end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
\vfill
\textbf{Proof:}
[$\mathbf{1\implies 2}$]
$(x,y)$ an arc of $G$; there is a path from $y$ to $x$ ($G$ strongly connected), so arc $(x,y)$ is contained in a circuit of $G$

[$\mathbf{2\implies 3}$]
Suppose $G$ has a cocircuit containing arc $(x,y)$; then $G$ cannot have
a circuit containing this arc by the Arc Colouring Lemma (Lemma~\ref{lemma:arc_colouring_lemma} slide~\pageref{lemma:arc_colouring_lemma}) with
all arcs coloured black. This contradicts (2)

[$\mathbf{3\implies 1}$]
Assume $G$ connected graph without cocircuits, but $G$ not strongly connected.
Since $G$ not strongly connected, it has $>1$ strongly
connected component. 
Since $G$ connected, there exist two distinct strongly connected components that are joined by an arc $(a,b)$. Arc $(a,b)$ is not contained in any circuit because otherwise $a$ and $b$ would be in the same strongly connected component. 
By Lemma~\ref{lemma:arc_colouring_lemma}, arc $(a,b)$ is contained in some co-
circuit. This contradicts (3)\qed

$G=(X,U)$ strongly connected without loops and $>1$ vertex. For each $x\in X$, there is a path from it and a path to it so $x$ has at least 2 incident arcs. Specifically,
\begin{itemize}
\item $x\in X$ with $>2$ incident arcs is a \textbf{node}
\item $x\in X$ with $2$ incident arcs is an \textbf{anti-node}

A path whose only nodes are its endpoints is a \textbf{branch}

\vfill
\begin{definition}[Minimally connected graph]
$G$ is \textbf{minimally connected} if it is strongly connected and removal of any arc destroys strong-connectedness
\end{definition}
A minimally connected graph is 1-graph without loops
\vfill
\begin{definition}[Contraction]
$G=(X,U)$. The \textbf{contraction} of the set $A\subset X$ of vertices consists in replacing $A$ by a single vertex $a$ and replacing each arc into (resp. out of) $A$ by an arc with same index into (resp. out of) $a$
\end{definition}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\begin{theorem}
$G$ minimally connected, $A\subset X$ generating a strongly connected subgraph of $G$. Then the contraction of $A$ gives a minimally connected graph
\end{theorem}
\vfill
\textbf{Proof:}
First, show that contraction of $A$ yields a 1-graph. 
If this were not the case, there would exist $x\not\in A$ and $a,a'\in A$ s.t. $(x,a),(x,a')\in U$ (or, with $(a,x),(a',x)\in U$ but this would not
change the proof). 
If one of these arcs is removed, the graph remains strongly
connected. Thus, $G$ is not minimally connected, a contradiction

\vskip1cm
Now show that the contraction of $A$ yields a graph $G'$ that is minimally connected. Clearly, $G'$ strongly connected. If an arc $u$ is removed, the remaining graph is not strongly connected, since the graph
$(X,U-\{u\})$ not strongly connected \qed

\begin{frame}{Adjacency matrix}
	We have already seen adjacency matrices, let us recall the definition here
	\begin{definition}[Adjacency matrix]
		$G$ a 1-graph, then the \textbf{adjacency matrix} $A=[a_{ij}]$ is defined as follows
		\[
		a_{ij} = \begin{cases}
			1 & \text{if arc } (i,j)\in U\\
			0 & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}
		\]
	\end{definition}
	\vfill
	We often write $A(G)$ and, reciprocally, if $A$ is an adjacency matrix, $G(A)$ the corresponding graph
	\vfill
	$G$ undirected $\implies$ $A(G)$ symmetric
	\vfill
	$A(G)$ has nonzero diagonal entries if $G$ is not simple
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Adjacency matrix (multigraph case)}
	\begin{definition}[Adjacency matrix of a multigraph]
		$G$ an $\ell$-graph, then the adjacency matrix $M_A=[m_{ij}]$ is defined as follows
		\[
		m_{ij} = \begin{cases}
			k & \text{if arc there are $k$ arcs } (i,j)\in U\\
			0 & \text{otherwise}
		\end{cases}
		\]
		with $k\leq \ell$
	\end{definition}

	$G$ undirected $\implies$ $M_A(G)$ symmetric
	\vfill
	$M_A(G)$ has nonzero diagonal entries if $G$ is not simple.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weighted adjacency matrices}
	Sometimes, adjacency matrices (typically for 1-graphs) have real entries, usually positive
	\vfill
	This means that the arcs/edges have been given a weight
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
	\begin{theorem}[{Number of walks of length $n$}]
		Let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of a graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$, where $V(G)=\{v_1,v_2, \dots , v_p\}$. Then the $(i,j)-$entry of $A^n$, $n\geq 1$, is the number of different walks linking $v_i$ to $v_j$ of length $n$ in $G$.
	\end{theorem}
	(two walks of the same length are equal if their edges occur in exactly the same order)
	
	Example: let $A$ be the adjacency matrix of a graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the $(i,i)-$entry of $A^2$ is equal to the degree of $v_i$.
		\item the $(i,i)-$entry of $A^3$ is equal to twice the number of $C_3$ containing $v_i$.

	Let $G=(V,E)$ be a graph of order $p$, and size $q$, with vertices denoted by $v_1, v_2, \dots , v_p$, and edges denoted $e_1, e_2, \dots , e_q$.
	\begin{definition}[{Incidence matrix}]
		The incidence matrix is $$B=B(G)=[b_{ij}]$$ is that $p\times q$ matrix in which
		$$b_{ij}=\left \{ 
		\begin{array}{cc}
			1 & \textrm{if } v_i \textrm{ is incident with } e_j\\
			0 & \textrm{otherwise}
		\end{array}
		\right .
		$$
	\end{definition}
	\begin{theorem}[{Incidence matrix and degrees}]
		The sum of the entries in row $i$ of the incidence matrix is the degree of $v_i$ in the graph.
	\end{theorem}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Incidence matrix}
	\begin{definition}[Incidence matrix -- Undirected case]
		$G=(X,E)$ an undirected graph of order $n$ with $p$ edges. The \textbf{incidence} matrix of $G$ is an $n\times p$ matrix with vertices as rows and edges as columns and where $B=[b_{ij}]$ satisfies
		\[
		b_{ij} = \begin{cases}

		\end{cases}
		\]
	\end{definition}
	\vfill
	\begin{definition}[Incidence matrix -- Directed case]
		$G=(X,U)$ a directed graph of order $n$ with $p$ arcs. The \textbf{incidence} matrix of $G$ is an $n\times p$ matrix with vertices as rows and edges as columns and where $B=[b_{ij}]$ satisfies
		\[

\begin{frame}{Spectrum of a graph}
	We will come back to this later, but for now..
	\vfill
	\begin{definition}[Spectrum of a graph]
		The \textbf{spectrum} of a graph $G$ is the spectrum (set of eigenvalues) of its associated adjacency matrix $A(G)$
	\end{definition}
	\vfill
	This is regardless of the type of adjacency matrix or graph
\end{frame}





\begin{frame}{Degree matrix}
	\begin{definition}[Degree matrix]

				d_G(v_i) & \text{if } i = j \\
				0 & \text{otherwise}
			\end{cases}
		\]
	\end{definition}
\vfill
In an undirected graph, this means that each loop increases the degree of a vertex by two
\vfill
In a directed graph, the term ``degree'' may refer either to indegree (the number of incoming edges at each vertex) or outdegree (the number of outgoing edges at each vertex)
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Laplacian matrix}
\begin{definition}
	$G=(X,U)$ a simple graph with $n$ vertices. The \textbf{Laplacian} matrix is 
	\[
		L=D(G)-A(G)
	\]
	where $D(G)$ is the degree matrix and $A(G)$ is the adjacency matrix
\end{definition}
$G$ simple graph $\implies$ $A(G)$ only contains 1 or 0 and its diagonal elements are all 0
\vfill
For directed graphs, either the indegree or outdegree is used, depending on the application
\vfill
Elements of $L$ are given by
\[
\ell_{ij}=\begin{cases}
	d_G(v_{i}) & \text{if } i=j\\
	-1 & \text{if } i\neq j \text{ and } v_{i}

	$$d_{ij}=
	dist(v_i,v_j).
	$$
	Note $d_{ii}=0$ for $i=1,\cdots, p$.
