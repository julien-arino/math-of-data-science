# We will be programming quite a bit

As already indicated, Data Science is a very hands-on discipline. We will be programming quite a bit in this course

Indeed, we can work out some of the examples "by hand", but to make things interesting, we typically need to consider larger examples where hand calculations are not pleasant or not even feasible

---

# R versus Python

Slightly different take on life :smiley:

In short: `Python` is more CS, `R` is more Stats/Math

Both are good languages for data science

In this course, assignments **must** use `R`

---

# R was originally for stats but is now more

- Open source version of S
- Appeared in 1993
- Now version 4.3
- One major advantage in my view: uses a lot of C and Fortran code. E.g., `deSolve`:
> The functions provide an interface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK' collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time steps
- Very active community on the web, easy to find solutions (same true of Python, I just prefer R)

---

# Getting your computer ready for the course

All computer coding will be in `R`; assignments will also need to be returned in `R`. For this reason, you will need to find a way to run `R`. Below are some methods, from the easiest to the most challenging.

Note that all options described below are Open Source (completely free). 

---

# In short...

- Terminal version, not very friendly
- Nicer terminal: [radian](https://github.com/randy3k/radian)
- Execute R scripts by using `Rscript name_of_script.R`. Useful to run code in `cron`, for instance
- Use IDEs:
    - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) has become the reference
    - [RKWard](https://invent.kde.org/education/rkward) is useful if you are for instance using an ARM processor (Raspberry Pi, some Chromebooks..)
- Integrate into jupyter notebooks

---

## Use syzygy.ca

[syzygy.ca](https://syzygy.ca) is a resource provided by the [Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences](https://www.pims.math.ca/) to students in various universities including ours. From the [webpage](https://syzygy.ca), click the blue *Launch* button at the top right and select UManitoba, click *Log in* on the following page and use your regular University of Manitoba log in information.

This will take you to a Jupyter notebook page, from which you can start notebooks.

The advantage with this method is that all you need is a web browser and access to the internet. The problem with this method is that you need access to the internet. Also, these are shared VMs, there can be downtime, access issues, etc.

---

## Install `R` and RStudio

This is probably the best option if you intend to go a little further than what we will do in the course. `R` is available on most platforms, while `RStudio` is available on most platforms except for Linux ARM devices (but can be compiled there)

Visit [https://www.r-project.org/](https://www.r-project.org/)

Choose your version: Windows or Mac. Under Linux, you can install directly from your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install R-base` for Debian-based distros)


To install RStudio, see [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)

---

## Install Jupyter and Jupyter notebook

This is the most complex way, but will give you access to locally hosted (on your machine) Jupyter notebooks, which you can use for both `R` and `Python`.

You will first need to install `Python` from [here](https://www.python.org/). Once `Python` is installed, you will need to install `Jupyter` and Jupyter notebooks by following the instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install). Then install `R` as indicated above (with this solution, you do not need to install RStudio). Then finally activate `R` support in Jupyter notebooks by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel).

As an option, you may want to install [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), if you want to use jupyter notebook to give a presentation, as is done for instance in Slides 04.

---

# Going further

- [RStudio server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-server): run RStudio on a Linux server and connect via a web interface
- Shiny: easily create an interactive web site running R code
- [Shiny server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/shiny-server/): run Shiny apps on a Linux server
- Rmarkdown: markdown that incorporates R commands. Useful for generating reports in html or pdf, can make slides as well..
- RSweave: LaTeX incorporating R commands. Useful for generating reports. Not used as much as Rmarkdown these days

# R is a scripted language

- Interactive
- Allows you to work in real time
    - Be careful: what is in memory might involve steps not written down in a script
    - If you want to reproduce your steps, it is good to write all the steps down in a script and to test from time to time running using `Rscript`: this will ensure that all that is required to run is indeed loaded to memory when it needs to, i.e., that it is not already there..

# Assignment

Two ways:

```R
X <- 10
```

or

```R
X = 10
```

First version is preferred by R purists.. I don't really care

---

# Lists

A very useful data structure, quite flexible and versatile. Empty list: `L <- list()`. Convenient for things like parameters. For instance

```R
L <- list()
L$a <- 10
L$b <- 3
L[["another_name"]] <- "Plouf plouf"
```

```R
> L[1]
$a
[1] 10
> L[[2]]
[1] 3
> L$a
[1] 10
> L[["b"]]
[1] 3
> L$another_name
[1] "Plouf plouf"
```

---

# Vectors

```R
x = 1:10
y <- c(x, 12)
> y
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 12
z = c("red", "blue")
> z
[1] "red"  "blue"
z = c(z, 1)
> z
[1] "red"  "blue" "1"
```
Note that in `z`, since the first two entries are characters, the added entry is also a character. Contrary to lists, vectors have all entries of the same type

---

# Matrices

Matrix (or vector) of zeros
```R
A <- mat.or.vec(nr = 2, nc = 3)
```

Matrix with prescribed entries

```R
B <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nr = 2, nc = 2)
> B
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    3
[2,]    2    4
C <- matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nr = 2, nc = 2, byrow = TRUE)
> C
     [,1] [,2]
[1,]    1    2
[2,]    3    4
```

Remark that here and elsewhere, naming the arguments (e.g., `nr = 2`) allows to use arguments in any order

---

# Matrix operations

Probably the biggest annoyance in R compared to other languages

- The notation `A*B` is the *Hadamard product* $A\circ B$ (what would be denoted `A.*B` in matlab), not the standard matrix multiplication
- Matrix multiplication is written `A %*% B`

---

# Vector operations

Vector addition is also frustrating. Say you write `x=1:10`, i.e., make the vector
```R
> x
 [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10
```
Then `x+1` gives
```R
> x+1
 [1]  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11
 ```
 i.e., adds 1 to all entries in the vector

 Beware of this in particular when addressing sets of indices in lists, vectors or matrices

---

# For the matlab-ers here

- R does not have the keyword `end` to access the last entry in a matrix/vector/list..
- Use `length` (lists or vectors), `nchar` (character chains), `dim` (matrices.. careful, of course returns 2 values)

---

# Flow control

```R
if (condition is true) {
  list of stuff to do
}
```

Even if `list of stuff to do` is a single instruction, best to use curly braces

```R
if (condition is true) {
  list of stuff to do
} else if (another condition) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
```

---

# For loops

`for` applies to lists or vectors

```R
for (i in 1:10) {
  something using integer i
}
for (j in c(1,3,4)) {
  something using integer j
}
for (n in c("truc", "muche", "chose")) {
  something using string n
}
for (m in list("truc", "muche", "chose", 1, 2)) {
  something using string n or integer n, depending
}
```

---

# lapply

Very useful function (a few others in the same spirit: `sapply`, `vapply`, `mapply`)

Applies a function to each entry in a list/vector/matrix. Because there is a parallel version (`parLapply`) that we will see later, worth learning

```R
l = list()
for (i in 1:10) {
        l[[i]] = runif(i)
}
lapply(X = l, FUN = mean)
```

or, to make a vector

```R
unlist(lapply(X = l, FUN = mean))
```

or

```R
sapply(X = l, FUN = mean)
```

---

# "Advanced" lapply

Can "pick up" nontrivial list entries

```R
l = list()
for (i in 1:10) {
        l[[i]] = list()
        l[[i]]$a = runif(i)
        l[[i]]$b = runif(2*i)
}
sapply(X = l, FUN = function(x) length(x$b))
```

gives

```R
[1]  2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20
```

Just recall: the argument to the function you define is a list entry (`l[[1]]`, `l[[2]]`, etc., here)

---

# <!--fit-->Avoid parameter variation loops with expand.grid

```R
# Suppose we want to vary 3 parameters
variations = list(
    p1 = seq(1, 10, length.out = 10),
    p2 = seq(0, 1, length.out = 10),
    p3 = seq(-1, 1, length.out = 10)
)

# Create the list
tmp = expand.grid(variations)
PARAMS = list()
for (i in 1:dim(tmp)[1]) {
    PARAMS[[i]] = list()
    for (k in 1:length(variations)) {
        PARAMS[[i]][[names(variations)[k]]] = tmp[i, k]     
    }
}
```

There is still a loop, but you can split this list, use it on different machines, etc. And can use `parLapply`
